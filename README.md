# Laundry: Folding spreadsheets into neat shapes

Spreadsheets are easy to record and manipulate data with but do a poor job of displaying the data in an easy to read way. Laundry provides a simple way of converting spread data into word by by specifying the output document's format within the spreadsheet itself.

While spreadsheets are, in manner aspects, similar to database tables, Laundry is only a formatting tool and not a database.

### Overview

Laundry operates by:

1. Having a spreadsheet containing some organised data stored in the `data_worksheet`.

2. Defining the output structure within a separate worksheet contained within the spreadsheet. This is known as the `structure_worksheet`.

3. The `structure_worksheet` references data to be formatted by using the the data's column names, the styles contained within the `template_file`, and how the data will be arranged, for example, as a table, paragraph or photo. The `structure_worksheet` does have a specific format that must be used to ensure that the conversion process takes place.

4. A `template_file` Word document (`.docx` file) is used as the basis of the output file. This file will contain the styles that will be used to format the output file.

5. The app is run using the command line interface (CLI).


## Manual

### Input File

The `input_file` is the spreadsheet that contains the data to be formatted and exported to the `output_file`.

The `input_file` __must__ contain a worksheet that contains the structure or output formatting requirements of the output file: this is the `structure_worksheet`.

The `input_file`'s data is stored in the `data_worksheet`. This worksheet can be given any name provided it doesn't clash with the `structure_worksheet` name.

### Structure Worksheet

The following column names __must__ implemented in the `structure_worksheet`. If they are not used the app will not work.

#### `sectiontype`
This defines the type of section that will be inserted with the output document. The top-to-bottom order will determine the order of the types in the `output_file`. The options that are currently supported are:

- `para`: This will insert a paragraph with the column header being the paragraph title styled using the style defined in `sectionstyle`.

- `table`: Will insert a table that contains the data contained in `sectioncontains` cell with the table column containing the same column heading as the original data (with any underscores removed).

- `heading`: Will use the data contained within the cell as a section heading made up of a title (column heading) and a paragraph (cell contents).

- `photo`: Inserts one or more photos (images) into the paragraph. Multiple images can be added by including them in the `sectioncontains` column. The `photo` column heading is used to provide a file path to the directory containing the files.

#### `sectioncontains`
This contains one or more of the column names used in the `data` worksheet. Multiple column names can be used with `table` using  `sectiontypes` provided the are separated by `new lines` (alt + enter) in the cell, or commas.  `new lines` are the preferred method.

#### `sectionstyle`
This Word *style* contained within the `template_file`'s `.docx` file. If this style is not in the `template_file` then Word's default styles will be used. *This is a limitation of Word*.

#### `titlestyle`
The Word formatting style to be used for titles within the document. This column does not apply to tables.

#### `sectionbreak`
Must be either `True` or `False`. If `True` it will insert an empty paragraph provide a visual break between it and the following paragraph.

#### `pagebreak`
Must be either `True` or `False`. If `True` it will insert a page break (that is, start a new page) after the paragraph. This is useful for clearly separating information that is related to different `data_worksheet` rows.

##### `path`
This defines the relative file path to the directory (folder) containing the photos. All photos referenced in the cell must be stored in the same directory.

### `sectiontype` Limits

Each of the `sectiontypes` have some limit regarding their operation.

- Where `heading` is used it should be a single column heading per paragraph.

- Where `paragraph` is used it should be a single column heading per paragraph.

- `table` can use any number of columns headings. Each column heading should be separated by a `newline` (preferred option) or by a comma (`,`).

- `sectionstyles` _can_ only be a single value. This is a string (text) that can contain spaces. Make sure that the spelling and capitalisation is correct.

- `titlestyles` _can_ only be a single value. This is a string (text) that can contain spaces. Make sure that the spelling and capitalisation is correct.

- `pagebreak` is a `True`/`False` value.

## Arranging Spreadsheet Data

### `data_worksheet`

The `data_worksheet` contains the data that will be formatted into the `output_file`.

1. The column headers should be in row 0 (that is, the first row) in the worksheet. If not, the `--data-head` option must to be used, *and* the row number specified.  For example if the column headers start on row 5:

    `Laundry -df=5 -t <template-file> <input-file> <output-file>`

2. Do not use numbers for column header names. This will cause problems.

3. Column header names *should* avoid spaces, and either use underscores (`_`) or use camel case (`ThisIsAnExampleOfCamelCase`). Stick numbers at the end of the names if you need numbers in the name.

4. If you want multiple paragraphs or bullet points, or more than one image, then use alt-enter in an Excel cell to allow this to take place.

5. Include the file extension (for example `.jpg`, `.png`) when entering including images in the cell. File extensions are part of the file name and the app expects them to be included.

### `structure_worksheet`

1. The column headers must be in row 0 (that is, the first row) in the worksheet. If not, the app will not work.

2. The `sectiontype` must be one of the following:

    - `photo`
    - `para`
    - `table`
    - `heading`

3. `table` sections do not require a value for `titlestyle`.

4. `photo` sections do not require a value for `titlestyle` or `sectionstyle`, however they do require `path` to be completed.

5. `sectionbreak` and `pagebreak` must be `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

## FAQs

The following is a list of commonly experienced issues.

### I get something containing `KeyError` and what looks like a column header

The likely culprit is an incorrectly spealt column header in the `structure_worksheet` or you haven't allowed for the conversion of underscores (`_`) replacing spaces within the column headers.


### Something like `No sheet named <[some_worksheet_name]>`

Check the `data_worksheet` and `structure_worksheet` names that you've used when running the app from the CLI. Check for spelling mistakes.

### `Error: Invalid value for "input_file"` appears

Check the spelling of the `input_file`'s name and that the file path is correct. The app will check that the `input_file` exists before attempting to run the app.

### `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'lower'`

The likely issue here is the column headers are not contained in the first row of the `data_worksheet`. Also check that none of the column headers are numbers.

### `Error: Invalid value for "--template" / "-t": Path "[some_path_&_filename].docx" does not exist.`

The `template_file` filename is incorrect. This could also be the path to the file. Check both.

### I have a heap of formatted empty pages at the bottom of my `converted_file`.

For each row of your `data_worksheet` that contains some data the app will produce a formatted section. By removing all the rows that you don't want at the bottom of the `data_worksheet` you can prevent this from occurring. There is a way to drop rows that are missing data, however this requires some work to enable this feature.

### `KeyError: "no style with name '[some_Word_style]'"`

The Word formatting style is not present in the `template_file`. Check that the style name matches exactly its name in Word.

### How do I use a specific Word style?

Due to limitations with Word user specific styles need to be saved to  the `template_file` for them to be available. If the specified name is not present in the `template_file` then the app will not function.
